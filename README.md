The family cost tracker

The goal is to practice array methods!

As you can see on the first page, you can log into 4 different users

After you logged in, you can add new income, expense and transfer.

Please be awared that the transfer is only available between 4 accounts from logIn page.

In order to transfer money to other account,
you need to type into 'Transfer to' field: 'mm' || 'nn' || 'ss' || 'mbm'

In my next project I will practice Async JS, Error Handling and the Constructor functions! ðŸ˜Š
